# Welcome to the GIMP ML wiki!
This repository introduces GIMP3-ML, a set of Python plugins for the widely popular GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It enables the use of recent advances in computer vision to the conventional image editing pipeline. Applications from deep learning such as monocular depth estimation, semantic segmentation, mask generative adversarial networks, image super-resolution, de-noising and coloring have been incorporated with GIMP through Python-based plugins. Additionally, operations on images such as edge detection and color clustering have also been added. GIMP-ML relies on standard Python packages such as numpy, scikit-image, pillow, pytorch, open-cv, scipy. In addition, GIMP-ML also aims to bring the benefits of using deep learning networks used for computer vision tasks to routine image processing workflows. 

The plugins have been tested with GIMP 2.99 on the following machines: <br>
[1] ubuntu 20.04 LTS <br>
[2] Windows 10
